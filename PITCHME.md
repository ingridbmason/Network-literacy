Note:
Network literacy is useful for research data managers and researchers handling and moving data either large single files or many many files in the GB-PB scale. Time spent testing network speeds and calculating transfer times aids to determine whether tools and methods for data upload and transfer are fit-for-purpose.

### Talking Points
- Advanced research networks
- Global NREN* network
- Network features

<p style="font-size:0.6em; color:gray">\*NREN = national research and education network </p> 

Note:
AARNet is Australia's national research and education network, or NREN.  AARNet's advanced research network infrastructure interconnects Australian institutions and organisations involved in research and education with the global research and education network community and resources across multiple 10, 40 and 100 gigabit per second (Gbps) links.

Note: 
Australia is a large continent, and the networks AARNet provides enable data capture and research to be conducted in major cities and in regional areas, where universities and research facilities and infrastructure are located, e.g. the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) in Canberra and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in Murchison (WA).

Note:
Australia lies at a distance from research conducted in other parts of the world, like the northern hemisphere, and the networks AARNet provides, aid in removing distance as a barrier, to research collaboration.
